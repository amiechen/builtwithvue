# Project 1: Wunderlist Clone

## Project setup

- Installation: `yarn install`
- Compiles and hot-reloads for development: `yarn run serve`
- Compiles and minifies for production: `yarn run build`
- Run your unit tests: `yarn run test:unit`
- Lints and fixes files: `yarn run lint`

## What I've learned

- vue-router, components, attributes, methods, simplified store like vuex, slots, events, fetchData before navigation in vue-router, make filters work with v-for, transition & transition-group, toggle
- how to write unit tests with mocha-webpack
- how to use store (not vuex, but same idea) to store data
- how to make sure vue re-render when data changed?
